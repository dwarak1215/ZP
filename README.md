# ZP
To fulfill the requirement
- We are using only one product catalog to overcome scalability and performance related issues.
- I have taken OOTB apparel product for the POC
- Since, We have restrictions about selling base product, I have extended variant product for single product, multiproduct and mixed case
- Created a many-many relation for apparel Product and mixed Case to satisfy the requirement.
- Please find the created item-types in the shared trainingcore-items.xml file.
- I have tried to create search restriction for product manager so he can see only products eligible for corresponding country.
- Please see the UML diagram in design word document.
Please run products.impex to see sample data
